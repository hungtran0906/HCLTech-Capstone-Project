# HCLTech-Capstone-Project
This Repo is my Capstone Project about CAN Protocol on STM32F405 custom board with 10 different levels

## Details about levels
- Level 1: Filter Configuration – Unearthing two identifier Register Bus hampering CAN data reception in the LCD.
- Level 2: CAN API – Debug CAN starting issue in Rx and Tx CAN API and perform successful loopback.
- Level 3: Half Duplex Communication Bug – Initialization issue in Strobe, Baud Settings for Master – Slave Configuration. 
- Level 4: Simultaneous CAN Rx Tx Debug – Full Duplex simulation and logging.
- Level 5: CAN Messaging Scenario - Periodic and Aperiodic messaging with timers and interrupt concepts.
- Level 6: Capturing CAN Transmit & Receive Bugs through GPIO event triggering and logging.
- Level 7: Advanced CAN bus connection issue – With ADC input or IR Sensing for automotive obstacle detection and speed increase.
- Level 8: Potentiometer triggering CAN messaging – with a combination of bugs in Security Alarm & Airbag Control. 
- Level 9: RTC Tamper use case – Connecting Can through APIs to receive critical timestamps.
- Level 10: Level to unearth Remote Request frames, Filter Configuration, Buffer Management and Mailbox scenario.
